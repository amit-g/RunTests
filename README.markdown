# Run Tests

This is a simple addon that adds a context menu and tool menu to run the the tests in current context.
The Visual Studio 2012 disables both Run Tests and Debug Tests if the main project is being debugged.
Visual Studio 2010 used to only disbale Debug Tests. The test runner is still able to run the tests, it
is just that the menu option is disabled. This menu option is needed only in certain kind of projects.
